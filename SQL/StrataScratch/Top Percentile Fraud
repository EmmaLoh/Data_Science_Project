ABC Corp is a mid-sized insurer in the US and in the recent past their fraudulent claims have increased significantly for their personal auto insurance portfolio. They have developed a ML based predictive model to identify propensity of fraudulent claims. Now, they assign highly experienced claim adjusters for top 5 percentile of claims identified by the model.
Your objective is to identify the top 5 percentile of claims from each state. Your output should be policy number, state, claim cost, and fraud score.
Target:to identify the top 5 highest claims in each state

2nd
Calculate the top 5 percentile of the fraud score column within each row/state And set it as subquery
Select state,
          percentile_cont(0.05) Within Group (Order by fraud_score Desc) AS percentile
   From fraud_score
   Group By state


3rd
The main query then selects the policy_num, state, claim_cost, and fraud_score columns from the fraud_score table and joins it with the percentiles on their state columns. The results are filtered to only include rows where the fraud_score is greater than or equal to the corresponding percentile value.
With percentiles AS
  (Select state,
          percentile_cont(0.05) Within Group (Order by fraud_score Desc) AS percentile
   From fraud_score
   Group By state
)
Select policy_num,
       f.state,
       claim_cost,
       fraud_score
From fraud_score f
Join percentiles p On f.state = p.state
Where fraud_score >= percentile
