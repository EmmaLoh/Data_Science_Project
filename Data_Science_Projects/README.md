|1.|5th Aug 2021 to 22th Aug 2021|Predict Potential Clients for a Portugese bank|By analysing clients features, the bank will be able to predict customer saving behaviours and identify which type of customers is more likely to make term deposits.This dataset was collected from each client about their basic information,financial status , the frequency of contact with last campaign and social and economic context.The goal of this project is to improve the effectiveness of the bank's telemarketing campaign. Developed this as a project for internship.The result of the project was A.|https://github.com/EmmaLoh/Portfolio/blob/main/Data_Science_Projects/PRCP-1000_Portugese_Bank_Marketing_Project.ipynb|
|2.|23th Aug 2021 to 2nd Sep 2021|Prediction for Bike Rental count daily and hourly|Using historical usage patterns and weather data, forecast bike rental demand on daily or hourly basis for the future planning in India capital. Developed this as a project for internship.The result of the project was A.|Hourly https://github.com/EmmaLoh/Portfolio/blob/main/Data_Science_Projects/PRCP-1018_Bike_Rental_Project_Hour.ipynb  Daily https://github.com/EmmaLoh/Portfolio/blob/main/Data_Science_Projects/PRCP-1018_Bike_Rental_Project_day.ipynb|
|3.|3rd Sep 2021 to 16th Sep 2021|Healthcare Analytics|Hospitals are faced with severely limited resources including beds to hold admitted patients. Disease diagnosis and estimating patients at higher risk are important for optimal management. Predicting a patient's length of stay at the time of admission helps hospitals to allocate resources more efficiently and manage their patients more effectively. Identifying factors that associate with a length of Stay (LOS) to predict and manage the number of days patients stay, could help hospitals in managing resources and in the development of new treatment plans. Effective use of hospital resources and reducing the length of stay can reduce overall national medical expenses. Developed this as a project for internship. The result of the project was A.
