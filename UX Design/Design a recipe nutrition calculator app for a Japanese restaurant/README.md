#### Leah
Age: 42

Education: Doctor of Medicine (MD)

Hometown: Newport, Rhode Island

Family: Single, lives alone

Occupation: Doctor

Leah is a doctor with a busy and demanding schedule. She works unpredictable shifts in a mid-size hospital, and swims for a local semi-professional team. Leah has a visual impairment for which she uses screen reader technologies. This technology makes using apps and websites much more convenient for Leah, but not all apps and websites are optimized for screen reader usage. 

Leah cares a lot about being available to her patients and is often taking appointments at the last minute. She would like to be able to spend as much of her non-work time as possible on her hobbies and personal life. Leah would like for there to be an easier and efficient way to order food, groceries, and personal care items to pick up on-the-go.
