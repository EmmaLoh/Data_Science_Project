Project Description:By analysing clients features, the bank will be able to predict customer saving behaviours and identify which type of customers is more likely to make term deposits.                                                                                                                                                  
This dataset was collected from each client about their basic information,financial status , the  frequency of contact with last campaign and social and economic      context.The goal of this project is to improve the effectiveness of the bank's telemarketing campaign. Developed this as a project for internship.The result of the   project was A.

Project:Healthcare Analytics

Project Description: Hospital are faced with severely limited resources including beds to hold admitted patients. Disease diagnosis and estimating patients at higher risk is important for the optimal management. By predicting a patient's length of stay at the time of admission helps hospital to allocate resources more efficiently and manage their patients more effectively.Identifying factors that associate with length of Stay (LOS) to predict and manage the number of days patients stay,could help hospitals in managing resources and in the development of new treatment plans. 
Effective use of hospital resources and reducing the length of stay can reduce overall national medical expenses. Developed this as a project for internship.The result of the project was A.
